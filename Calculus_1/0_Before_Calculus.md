### Introduction To Functions {docsify-ignore}

Mathematicians and Scientists use functions to describe the relationship between variables and quantities.

**Definition:**
If a variable y depends on a variable x in such a way that each value of x determines exactly one value of y, then we say that *y is a function of x.*

Another way to define a function is to think of it as a machine. The machine takes in an input and produces and output.

**Picture of Machine**

Here we can see that the machine itself is an object so we can define it as say f. Thus giving us a new definition for a function:

A function f is a rule that associates a unique output with each input. If the input is denoted by x, then the output is denoted by f(x). ( The word "unique" means exactly one)

### Independent and Dependent Variables {docsify-ignore}
For any input of x, the output of a function is the value of f atx/ Sometimes the output of functions are denoted by a single letter, say y:

"Insert Picture"

The x variable above is the Independent Variable and the y is the Dependent Variable, this makes sense because  doesn't depend on anything, you definite it yourself, while the y depends on what you give in for x.

**Example: Functional Relationships**

#### $f(0)=3$ {docsify-ignore}
f associates y=3 with x=0.
#### $f(1)=4$ {docsify-ignore}
f associates y=4 with x=1.
#### $f(2)=-1$ {docsify-ignore}
f associates y=-1 with x=2.
#### $f(3)=6$ {docsify-ignore}
f associates y=6 with x=3.

**Example:**

### $y=3x^2-4x+2 \\\\ f(x)=3x^2-4x+2$ {docsify-ignore}

#### $f(0)=3(0)^2-4(0)+2=2$ {docsify-ignore}
f associates y=2 with x=0.
#### $f(-1.7)=3(-1.7)^2-4(-1.7)+2=17.47$ {docsify-ignore}
f associates y=17.47 with x=-1.7.
#### $f(\sqrt{2})=3(\sqrt{2})^2-4(\sqrt{2})+2=8-4\sqrt{2}$ {docsify-ignore}
f associates $y=8-4\sqrt{2}$ with $x=\sqrt{2}$.

### Graphs of Functions: {docsify-ignore}

If a function f is real valued then the graph of the function in the xy-plane is defined as the graph of the equation.


**Graphs of Common Functions:**

## $f(x)=x$ {docsify-ignore}
![Graph of y=x](https://github.com/mustafaaljadery/mustafaaljadery.github.io/blob/master/images/y%3Dx.png?raw=true)
## $f(x)=x^2$ {docsify-ignore}
![Graph of y=x^2](https://github.com/mustafaaljadery/mustafaaljadery.github.io/blob/master/images/y%3Dx%5E2.png?raw=true)
## $f(x)=x^3$ {docsify-ignore}
![Graph of y=x^3](https://github.com/mustafaaljadery/mustafaaljadery.github.io/blob/master/images/y%3Dx%5E3.png?raw=true)
## $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ {docsify-ignore}
![Graph of y=1/x](https://github.com/mustafaaljadery/mustafaaljadery.github.io/blob/master/images/y%3Dx%5E-1.png?raw=true)
## $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ {docsify-ignore}
![Graph of y=x^(1/2)](https://github.com/mustafaaljadery/mustafaaljadery.github.io/blob/master/images/y%3Dsqrtx.png?raw=true)
## $f(x)=\sqrt[3]{x}$ {docsify-ignore}
![Graph of y=x^(1/3)](https://github.com/mustafaaljadery/mustafaaljadery.github.io/blob/master/images/y%3Dcuberootx.png?raw=true)

Graphs can help provide visual information about a function.

### The Vertical Line Test {docsify-ignore}
The Vertical Line Test is best described by example:

"Insert Image"

Teh curve in this example can tbe a functipn. From our knowledge of the xy-plane, we know that each point on the graph can we written as (x,y) or (x, f(x)). Now lets take a look at the curve, we have two different points, (a,b) and (a,c). "a", our idnependent variable outputs two different points "b" and "c", thus making it not a function.

**The Formal Definition of The Vertical Line Test:**
A curve in the xy-plane is the graph of some function f if and only if no vertical line intersects the curve more than once.

**Example:**
### $x^2+y^2=25$ {docsify-ignore}
![x^2+y^2=25](https://github.com/mustafaaljadery/mustafaaljadery.github.io/blob/master/images/x%5E2%2By%5E2%3D25.png?raw=true)

This certainly is not a fucntion as there are many vertical lines that ctouch the curve of the graph at more than one point.

### The Absolute Value Function {docsify-ignore}
$ x = \cases{
x & x\geq 0 
-x & x\lesssim 0 $

The absolute value function strips out the minus sign if the input is less than 0 and leaves the input alone of its more than or equal to zero.

\\[ |5|=5   |0|=0    |-7|=-7 \\]

Properties of The Absolute Value Function:

"insert"
 A number and its negative have the same absolute value.
 The absolute value of a product is the product of the avsolute values.
 The absolute value of a ratio is the ratio of the absolute values.
 The triangle inequality.

### Piece-wise Defined Functions {docsify-ignore}
**Definiton:**
A piece-wise function is a function built from pieces of different functions over different intervals.

"example"

![Piece-wise Function Graph](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/gtygd7igbs)
The formula above changes at the points x=-1 and x=1(The breakpoints of the formula). To graph piece-wise functions, you graph each equations on its respective domain.

### Domain and Range {docsify-ignore}
**Domain:**
The allowable inputs in an equation(x-values).

**Range:**
The set of outputs as x varies over the domain(y-values).
